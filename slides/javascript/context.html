  - regular functions have their own context which is set when they're called
  - arrow functions inherit their context from their surrounding scope
  - `this` can be set explicitly with call(), apply() and bind()
  - determining `this`:
    1. if the function is called as a constructor (new):
      `this` refers to the object('s prototype chain) that's returned from the constructor
    2. if the function is called with call() or apply() or bound with bind():
      `this` refers to the explicitly specified object
    3. if the function is called as an object property (method):
      `this` refers to the object('s prototype chain) (also applies when function is set to prop later)
    4. default:
      `this` inside the function is undefined (strict mode) or the global object
  - common pitfalls
    - callbacks
    - DOM event handlers (`this` is bound to the element that emits the event)
  - advice:
    - prefer arrow functions over regular functions
