<!--
  - Differences with promises (problems observables solve)
  - Concepts:
    - Observable: a stream of (future) values.
    - Subscription: a "running" observable, can be used to stop the observable from executing.
    - Observer: a collection of functions that react to values and events delivered by an observable.
    - Operator: a function to alter (a) stream(s) of (future) values.
    - Subject: like an observable that can also "write" values.
  - Common operators
  - Different subjects
  - Hot/cold observables
